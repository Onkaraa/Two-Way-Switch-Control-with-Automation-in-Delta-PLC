Two-Way Switch Control with Automation in Delta PLC
Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a two-way switch control system using Delta PLC with automation. It allows users to control a load from two different locations using a two-way switch configuration. The system is designed to automate the switching process and provide efficient control over connected devices.

Features
Two-Way Switch Control: Allows users to control a device from two different locations.
Automation: The PLC automates the switching process based on specific logic.
Delta PLC Integration: The system is controlled by a Delta PLC, with the logic programmed to handle the two-way switch and automation functions.
HMI Interface (optional): A user-friendly HMI interface can be used to monitor and control the switching operation.
Requirements
Delta PLC hardware
Delta PLC programming software (e.g., WPLSoft or ISPSoft)
Optional HMI software (e.g., DOPSoft) for user interface
Installation
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the PLC project using Delta PLC software (WPLSoft or ISPSoft).
Upload the project to your Delta PLC.
(Optional) Open the HMI project using DOPSoft and upload it to your HMI device.
Power on the system and test the two-way switch control functionality.
Usage
Control the Load: Use the two-way switches to control the load from either location.
Automation: The PLC handles the logic for switching based on the two-way switch positions and automation rules.
